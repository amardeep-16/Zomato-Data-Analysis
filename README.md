# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Worked on an end-to-end Zomato Data Analysis project using Python. Cleaned and preprocessed real-world restaurant data, handled missing values, and transformed rating and cost features. Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior, restaurant categories, pricing trends, and the effect of online ordering on ratings.
